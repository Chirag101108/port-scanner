This project is a multi-threaded port scanner with an integrated listener, similar to Netcat, for capturing reverse shells. The scanner identifies open ports on a target and generates a detailed report of the scan.

## Features
- Multi-threaded port scanning for fast performance
- Banner grabbing to identify services running on open ports
- Netcat-like listener to capture reverse shell connections
- Report generation in text format after each scan

## Usage
